\begin{abstract}
The abstract shall go here! Here is some things to keep in mind while writing it.
\end{abstract}

\begin{itemize}
\item The abstract is likely the first substantive description of your work read by an examiner. View it as an opportunity to set accurate expectations.
\item The abstract is a summary of the whole thesis. It presents all the major elements of your work in a highly condensed form. (Write it having written the rest of the paper) The paper sets the abstract.
\item It must be capable of substituting for the whole paper when there is insufficient time and space for the full text.
\item Keep it short and snappy. 
\item The primary function of your thesis (and by extension your abstract) is not to tell readers what you did, it is to tell them what you discovered.
\item Approximately the last half of the abstract should be dedicated to summarizing and interpreting your results.
\item The most common error in abstracts is failure to present results.
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}
% An introduction, explaining the purpose of the document, a very brief outline of the project and a summary of the structure of the rest of the document (approximately 1-2 pages).

The Professional Software Development (PSD3) course at The University of Glasgow requires students to engage with the practices and methodologies used in modern large-scale software engineering. The purpose of this dissertation is to document the development of the software project created as part of this course by Team I. 

The project was to build, over the course of several months, a restaurant recommendation engine for the Glasgow-based company ResDiary.
The goal was to deliver a system which could produce recommendations for restaurants to a user, that could be integrated into their existing systems at a later date. 
% Do we delay mentioning the integration at this stage? - Joseph?
% Do we make it clear here it was recommendations based on similar users? - Joseph?

Our team consisted of six third-year Computing Science students. Within the group there was a broad array of skills, interests and experience - with two members actively working as software professionals, and another having participated in an internship. For some members, however, this was a first opportunity to interact with a real client. 

In this document we outline, in detail, the entire process: from the initial requirements gathering with our customer, through to final system delivery. 

In section \ref{sec:background} we present the background to the project, the motivations of the customer and how we arrived at the agreed deliverables.

%this will surely be expanded to enumerate each separate section better I would like to discuss in detail the practices, issue-tracking, the team work/team load - Josh etc.

In subsequent sections \ref{sec:alice} through Section \ref{sec:reflections} we explore the challenges we faced through development and the steps we took to resolve them, explore the impact of team dynamics on the outcome and reflect on what we have learned from the experience. We also explain how we applied the good development practices learned in PSD3. In particular we highlight the role of version control, agile development and issue tracking.

\section{Case Study Background}
\label{sec:background}
% A description of the case study background and context. This should include a description of the project customer (what was the nature of the organisation you were working for), their objectives for the project, and a summary of what was actually achieved. Where appropriate, this section should also make reference to similar related projects in order to make the context clear (approximately 4-5 pages).

% MISC POINTS TO DISCUSS:
% 1. Do we address the legal contract we signed. I.e. Initially it was proposed for integration into the site. It then changed and this we reflected in the contract we signed which outlined the final product and how it could be used be ResDiary - possibly get a more accurate summary of what ResDiary can do with the delivered product from them (ask them to summarise the contract essentially mentioning it is beneficial to our final report)

\subsection{Customer}
\label{customer}
% The customer organisation and background.

% Here we want answer the question of who are ResDiary and what do they do.
% Additionally answer who played the customer role of ResDiary to us on the project.

% Who are ResDiary?
ResDiary are a Glasgow-based online restaurant reservation system. They are a commercial organisation whose service provides a comprehensive, easy to use booking platform and table management system for use by both the hospitality industry and its guests. The service provides 24-hour reservation services via websites (!!! websites probably isn’t the right word here !!!) including Facebook and Twitter as well as their own booking portal ResDiary.com. Their global service sees 9.7 million covers booked every month and their technology is in use in over 6,500 restaurants across 58 countries.

Throughout the duration of the project ResDiary senior software engineers Adam Connelly and Ian Strachan acted as the representatives of ResDairy. They served as the point of contact between our team and the customer and provided useful feedback and answers to our queries throughout the development of the project. Additionally they also provided supplies of data for use within the project with the necessary steps taken by ResDiary to ensure the anonymity of their sensitive customer data.

\subsection{Customer Objectives And Rationale}
\label{custobjectives}
% The rationale and initial objectives for the project.

% Essentially with the intro we want to introduce the company and the aims of the project. Mention similar real world examples such as the Netflix model as this was used as a reference / example similar project early on in our project. Talk out the specification, reference the dropped features of the specification in relation to what was actually developed and presented to the customer. Potentially mention points of future expansion as well and how project was setup to account for those future developments.

% Possibly reflect on the change in specification that occurred - how it was originally proposed to what it evenually became both from our perspective (in terms of what we would develop) and how ResDiary wished to use the project (in that they intially proposed either integrating it into their system or creating an API to eventually just wanting it as a proof of concept to learn from).

% Essentially I want to introduce the customer and provide an overview of the motivation of the project.
% Project motivation comes from three reasons:
% 1. Improve restaurant discover on existing service 
%	2. Commerial reason as it is not something their competition does
%	3. Big data proof of concept research - they have large amount of big data they do nothing with and would like to see if using it for such a purpose would be useful

% This is rough but I'm trying to mainly hit on the motives and tease on some later developments


% Initial Meeting - Project Motivation - Initial Aims

The initial customer meeting occurred on October 19th and was led by Ian Strachan. This was our first contact with the customer and served as the customer requirements elicitation meeting. The meeting began with an overview of the ResDairy business (link to customer section above) and some background was given of the technologies of their system currently in place. This included some information on the particular development languages being used (primarily C\#) though the primary justification was to provide background context for the large quantities of data being gathered by ResDiary from their day-to-day operations. This large mass of big data however is currently unused and dormant which ResDiary view as a significant shortcoming of their existing system. 

(!!! ResDiary are currently exploring potential methods of utilising this massive quantity of data. -- Is this worth starting below paragraph with?  !!!)

Through utilisation of this large quantity of data they believe they will be able to distinguish themselves and gain a commercial edge over their competition. Having conducted some research they have found that none of their competitors currently offer a restaurant recommendation service within their particular booking platform. They believe such as system which makes recommendations to users based off their previous dining habits and similarity to other users will give them the edge over their competition. Additionally their belief is that such a feature will increase restaurant discovery on their service which will be of benefit to both their customers and the organisation itself.

The idea stems from the similar system provided by services such as Amazon and Netflix. The Netflix model in particular being the closest reference point for the system they wished to replicate due the intrinsic similarity between making recommendations based on a user’s history and similarity to other users tastes. As a starting point for our own research to understand attempts to solve similar problems they suggested looking into the 2009 Netflix Prize competition (!!! reference competition someone - talk what we took from from researching this later !!!). The goal competition was to produce the best algorithm which could accurately predict a user’s rating of a film based on previous ratings and no other additional information about the users or the films.

(!!! Having trouble transitioning out - to the end goals for the project - so will need to look this over !!!) 

While the primary focus of the project was to develop the recommendation system as a proof of concept for ResDiary, some time was spent discussing the potential of integrating the system into the existing ResDiary system. The proposed method was through the creation an API to link the two systems together though the customer elucidated our primary focus should be create the recommendation engine as this final goal was susceptible to change. This in part they explained was due to an internal transition in development technologies for the back end functionality of their service. As such whether the project would be integrated into the existing service or alternatively viewed as an R\&D project for a potential use of their big data had not yet been decided by the customer. 

(!!! Really, really, really don’t like the transition out here -- FIX !!!)

Ultimately it would be the latter of the two as the customer wished to view the project as a proof of concept to assess the benefits of utilising their big data in such a manner. Whether the additional development costs associated with integration would outweigh the benefits provided and whether the system could make smart recommendations based off the existing data provided to it. Through examining our system they believed they could answer such questions and use our system as a starting point to learn from so that a similar system could be integrating into their existing service.

% - Final state of project submitted

% Outline what research performed told us
Upon concluding the initial customer meeting the team decided to perform some
background reading into the subject of machine learning and creating a recommendation
engine (reference most relevant papers). Having performed the initial
research the team then met to decided upon a specification to present
to the customer at the next customer meeting on November 16th. The proposed
aims for the project at this stage were as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The recommendation engine must accurately suggest places to eat
  based on the user's own dining history and other users with similar
  eating preferences. The recommendations should be made in close
  proximity to where the user typically eats and the engine may allow
  for recommendations to be made to where users have previously
  visited but not eaten there recently.
\item The system should be created to allow for easy integration into
  the existing ResDiary system 
\end{itemize}

 With the initial research done the team then met to create an
initial specification that was presented to the customer. Although
the specification and aims of the project would change throughout
its development the initially proposed main aims of the project were
as follows:

The specification was then refined and redrafted to incorporate the
customer's feedback and
